# 🚨 Portainer Deployment Fix

## The Problem
You used `docker-compose.prebuilt.yml` which tries to pull from GitHub Container Registry, but that image doesn't exist yet.

## ✅ Solution: Use Build-from-Source

**Copy this to Portainer instead:**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  l484-app:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: l484-innovation-platform
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost/health", "||", "exit", "1"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

## 🔄 Alternative: Simple Build (If Above Fails)

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  l484-app:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.simple
    container_name: l484-innovation-platform
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## 🎯 Why the Error Happened

1. **docker-compose.prebuilt.yml** → Tries to pull `ghcr.io/tx1138/gabe:latest`
2. **That image doesn't exist** → GitHub Actions hasn't built it yet
3. **GitHub Container Registry** → Requires authentication for private repos

## 📋 Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Delete the current stack** in Portainer
2. **Create new stack** with the build-from-source YAML above
3. **Deploy** - it will build from your GitHub repository

## 🚀 Expected Timeline

- **Build time**: 3-5 minutes (first time)
- **Subsequent deploys**: 1-2 minutes (cached layers)

## 🔍 If Build Still Fails

Use the simple Dockerfile approach:
- Change `dockerfile: Dockerfile` to `dockerfile: Dockerfile.simple`
- This uses a single-stage build which is more reliable

## ✅ Success Indicators

When successful, you'll see:
- "Build completed successfully" in Portainer logs
- App accessible at your configured port/domain
- All L484 sections working with animations
